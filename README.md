Geoculture Demonstration application

#Description
This application is part of a thesis that has been assigned to me when i was studying at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
The application presents cultural information that is related to the current location of the device. The user is informed about songs that mention, or are connected on some conceptual level, with his current location. Moreover, the functionality of the application includes the discovery of movies, or any other official filming content, that contain the given geographical position in their filming locations list. The application is ideally used to identify the cucltural fingerprint of a location as well as a source of inspiration. Within the application, different data sources are combined in order to create the final brand new service.

#Note
Currently, the application is fully functional only in Greece, but it may have some functionallity in other countries ,too.

This application uses copyrighted content and it cannot be published until a license is acquired.
